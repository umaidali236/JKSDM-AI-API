She was given the name Annapurna by former Maharaja Brijnath Singh of the former Maihar Estate, which reportedly was a testament to her musical talent which was as lofty and profound as the Annapurna mountain. Annapurna Devi continued to provide music lessons for free, tutoring many to-be legendary musicians. Annapurna Devi was a profoundly gifted artist. Her father and guru, Allauddin Khan, steered her towards playing the surbahar â an instrument whose deep voice, meditative quality, larger size and difficulty in mastery make it extremely rare, even among aficionados. In 1977, the Indian government granted her one of its highest civilian awards, the Padma Bhushan; in 1991, she was given the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, the highest prize given to performing artists in India.

Born in Kukadsar, a small town in Kutch, she had to quit studying after the 4th grade. However, giving up was never an option for her. With her husband as her constant support, she not only invented a new form of machine embroidery, but also started an artisan enterprise that empowers tribal women. Today, her designs have crossed the borders of Kutch to be featured in Bollywood and Hollywood films, including clients across the globe. She was also among the 15 uniquely-skilled artisans who helped in the designing of Sui Dhaga logo that incorporated 15 different Indian art forms. Most recently, she was seen sitting on the hot seat of Amitabh Bachchan's Kaun Banega Crorepati.  *Â

But she set on a mission to spread awareness about natural fibers against plastic by promoting natural products. What started from a small room and with one tailor's help has now become an enterprise in Tondiarpet, where products like bags, files, and stationery products are stitched. âAs an alternative for synthetic products, I take orders for products made of cotton, bamboo fiber, jute, to name a few,â she said. âCorporate companies, which have a huge employee base, play an important role in spreading awareness against non-biodegradable products. They give away a lot of promotional products, which could be made using natural fibers,â said Jessie. âMNCs have become much more conscious about the use of natural fibers,â she added. Her unit now hires around 40 tailors who work with her six days a week. Speaking about her role, she said: âI do everything from meeting clients to taking orders, working on design, then as a salesperson and delivering too,â said Jessie, adding, âI believe my making such products popular among masses is the best role I can play to spread awareness. It has taken long, long years to reach here and where I stand today is the result of sheer hard workâ. Jessie, said the growth process was a tough one, yet humbling. The mother of two built her venture with a very small investment, amidst several challenges on the personal and business fronts. Jessie is aiming at export orders now.  *Â

In 2015, when she was pregnant with her daughter, her mother-in-law knitted a beautiful frock which she was completely taken by. Skilled in knitting and crocheting during her school days, she decided to take it up again. âI had always loved engaging in these activities but had lost touch over time. Seeing the beautiful frock, I was taken back to the time when I crocheted and made beautiful TV covers, handkerchiefs, and laces. So, I decided to try my hand at it again and in two days, I too had made a beautiful frock for my daughter,â recalls the 34-year-old. Over time, these beautiful handcrafted items started being noticed by her friends and acquaintances who would request her to knit items for their infants. The demand only grew â which pushed Tarishi towards identifying more people who knew the art of knitting and crocheting. She also felt that by starting a venture, she could support several women who could work from the comfort of their homes. This is what led to the birth of âAjoobaa' in 2018. Ajoobaa is a startup that sells handmade wool crochet and knitted wear that is available for children up to four years. The start-up is based out of Sonipat in Haryana where the operations are carried out actively. After Tarishi founded the start-up, her husband Nivesh too quit his job and started looking after the operations at Ajoobaa. Now, almost over four years later, Ajoobaa gets about 4,000 orders in a month! The start-up, in the last one year, has dressed at least 20,000 children. They are currently working with 112 artisans, mostly homemakers who make these beautiful products by hand. In the past year, Ajoobaa has had an annual turnover of Rs 1.4 Crore despite managing their operations on a small scale.  *Â

But the formation of those beads into a delicate jewelry piece amazed me. I realized beads are far more versatile than I thought.

It took seven years before Sneha decided to pursue her passion in jewellery making. And with he passion to become an entrepreneur, Yuvanta was born. Today Yuvanta has a large range of dÃ©cor items like long-beaded curtains, sparkling window-blinds, drapes, show-pieces and the like. Usual jewelry options like necklaces, earrings, nose-pins, head-wears, hair-do accessories, bracelets, anklets and others are also aplenty in Sneha's collection.

The artisans also export to Australia, Canada, the Middle East and South East Asia. The items are lattice work, pots, idols of gods and goddesses, animal figures, lamps, pillars, temple models, fountain and furniture. Gainda Lal Gujjar shares his experience - âMy friend Kalu Ram asked me to help him in his work and for working two to three hours he paid me Rs.12 to Rs.15 a day. I further honed my skills and I started earning Rs.100 a day. Now, we are four male members of the family doing this, and between us we make about INR 60,000 to INR 70,000 per month by taking job works of the bigger artisans.â The Centre for Development of Stones (CDOS), set up by the Rajasthan government, is a centre for excellence with state-of-the-art facilities with broad objectives to develop and promote and support the dimensional stones sector. The youth of the Gujjar area opted to attend the training and learnt to operate and maintain the machines. Tools and motors that are frequently used in the processing of stone earlier required one to go to Dausa or Jaipur for repairs. âThanks to the youth's interest, some of them acquired skills in not only carving stones, but also in handling and repairing small tools like cutters and motors. We trust them because they have been trained and know their jobs,â says Khairati Lal, a senior craftsman. âThe CDOS has over the years helped the artisans of Sikandra to upgrade their tools and skills, and encouraged them to interact with buyers. Now they do business through showrooms and have built their websites and published their own brochures,â said R.K. Gupta, CEO of CDOS.

I educated his children like mine, gave them the same pocket money and took care of them like my own and all my income was because of the taxi I was driving.

Harshini reminisced about the time she finally got accepted into the NFSC (National Fire Service College) she talked about how her father called to give her the good news as he held onto the telegram in his hand. Harshini's seven-semester course needed the students to live on campus, but for her, the rule was bent- allowing her to go home. Harshini worked with heavy water and suction hoses and performed mock drills with dummies. Her first assignment was a cylinder blast in Shirdi when she was in college. Harshini performed difficult tasks while she was just a student learning the ways of life and fire fighting at the same time. Before joining ONGC in 2006 (and eventually becoming the Sr. fire officer), she dealt with several fires across Mumbai, Kolkata and Delhi where her six-hour operation in a tin factory gained recognition. Today, Harshini is an inspiration to women all over the country.

Armed with degrees in engineering and masters in social entrepreneurship, they founded Sampurn(e)arth â a Mumbai-based startup focused on urban waste management. Vijaya Srinivasan, a client, shares that the residents of her neighbourhood were initially very reluctant. They didn't want to go through the whole process of having two separate bags and segregating food at the source. Six months of tireless campaigning later, the efforts of the team are starting to make a difference. Though there is a long way to go to change the perception of people, co-founder and director Debatra Banerjee feels that this change is headed in the correct direction. Sampurn(e)arth also works to provide waste collectors with dignity employing waste collectors to work under proper conditions. They earn more money, thanks to their recycling efforts. Above all, instead of being just âwaste pickers', they proudly wear on their sleeve the new title of âwaste managers.' Sampurn(e)arth was born out of a feeling of discontent and disenchantment and strived to correct many wrongs and change the mindset of the general population of the country.

The demand for this service started during the lockdown and has continued. Says Thilak from Shero, âWe have a simple form on our website. Once the home chef registers, we do a quick background check on them and their kitchen through a video call. If they adhere to the hygiene protocols, we get them the FSSAI licence. Then they will be given training sessions at our demo kitchen in Anna Nagar or virtually depending on the lockdown restrictions. They will be taught the basics of stocking up the pantry, quick recipes, packing techniques, social media skills and order management. This will prepare them to run their kitchen single-handedly,â. Among the many home chefs the platform has employed is Ayisha Mariyam, a resident of Purasawalkam. A mother of three, the homemaker has been effortlessly juggling her personal life and cooking for Shero, she says. It's been six months since she became a member of Shero while scouting online for jobs to do from home. âIt came in handy because I already knew cooking and I did not need an investment to enrol on the platform. I plan and finish my household chores, and then begin cooking for Shero. You have 30 minutes to prepare an order so until I finish preparing for one I will not accept other orders. At times, I may not have the necessary ingredients since this is a small-scale kitchen. The consumer is kept informed on other options through Swiggy and alternate arrangements are made. It's quite a flexible model,â narrates Mariyam. And it's not just cooking and dispatching.

Though he tried working as a security guard, it did not come off as he was afraid of working alone at night. So, finally, Pillai landed a job as a waiter at a hotel in the town with a monthly salary of Rs 450. After hours of slogging at the busy hotel, Pillai pursued pre-degree in a parallel college. Often he assisted the main cook in the kitchen by cutting vegetables. The chief cook took him under his wings after noticing that the newly-joined waiter was slicing sacks of onion faster than any of his trained assistants and taking a passionate interest in cooking. Pillai shelved his pre-degree plans due to work pressure, but it was the beginning of Pillai's journey to becoming one of the world's most celebrated chefs. Pillai's life is an inspiration to all and illustrates how one could scale heights with hard work and determination.

Being able to build confidence was crucial so a few of the organization's field staff moved into homes in neighbourhoods where aggregators livedâlike Seelampur in New Delhi or Kurla in Mumbai, India's financial capital. Eventually relationships were formed. Suhaib Malik is a third-generation aggregator, one of the hundreds based in Mustafabad. His father and grandfather traded in scrap iron for decades. The 26-year-old ventured into the unknown, but promising, e-waste sector in 2018 when he heard how others were making a lot more money by switching. Now he is expanding his operation further by doing business sustainably with Karo Sambhav. Working conditions in his shop and his financial bottom-line have improved. âWe don't even have to break down the keyboards anymore,â he says. âWe just hand them over as is.â This exempts his workers from hours of harmful labour dealing with toxic waste. Now, every couple of weeks a truck drives in to weigh the electronics and pack them neatly into bar-coded gunnysacks to be taken to certified responsible recyclers. Steady demand from this new customer means âbusiness has improved a lot,â notes Malik, whose shop has defunct CPUs and keyboards stacked outside. He sources e-waste from about 100 smaller dealers in New Delhi, as well as eastern Indian states of Bihar and West Bengal some 1,000 miles away.
